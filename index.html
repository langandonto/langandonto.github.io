    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      The idea of this workshop is to create a forum for the many ways in which research on ontologies and research in Computational Linguistics relate to each other. The latter will include both controlled and natural languages; the former will include research on ontology languages and linguistic ontologies. The workshop is topical because the role of ontologies in Computational Linguistics is now recognised as crucial, and because formal ontologies are increasingly used by people with limited background in formal logic, creating a growing interest (e.g., in connection with the Semantic Web and linked data) in the creation of natural and easily accessible front ends for ontologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Global interest in these topics is witnessed by recent projects such as NeOn (Lifecycle Support for Networked Ontologies), LEGO (Lexicon Enhancement via the GOLD Ontology), SWAT (Semantic Web Authoring Tool), PESCaDO (Personalized Environmental Service Configuration and Delivery Orchestration), CO-ODE, and WhatIf (What if. . . questions for Ontology Authoring). If successful, this event could become a key event in a series, and an important vehicle for exploiting common interests between research communities that tend to operate separately.
